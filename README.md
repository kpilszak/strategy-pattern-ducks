## General info
This project shows usage of strategy pattern.  
The main principles are:
* encapsulate what varies,
* favor composition over inheritance,
* program to interfaces, not implementations.  

In strategy pattern we define common interface which is implemented by classes with different behavior.  
There is also a client which has a reference of interface's type allowing the client to set behavior dynamically.

## Technologies

* Java  
IDE: Intellij IDEA 2018
